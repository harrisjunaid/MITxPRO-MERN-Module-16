### 16-11  Track Re-render With UseEffect
Track when React is re-rendering with the useEffect Hook.
Re-render is triggered when useState is changed.

</br>

###  16-10 Parent State Forces Re-Render
Force a child re-render from the parent component.
A change in parent's state is triggering a change in the state of the child (square components).

### React Component Lifecycle

#### Component Lifecycle:

| Mounting | Unmounting |
| :---     | :----      | 
| Creating a DOM node for a React component and inserting it into the DOM | Process of deleting or removing React components from the DOM |
| Component's life cycle begins at mounting which happens only once. |     | 
| `let someComponent = React.createElement(someComponent)`||  
| `ReactDOM.render(someComponent, document.getElementById("root"))`|`unmountComponentAtNode(document.getElementById('root'));`|  
|
